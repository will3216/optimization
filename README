These are some of the preliminary codes and structures for a piece of local search optimization software.

So far, a script has been written to parse a GAMS input code into python objects. 

The piece of code I am currently working on is nearly finished. This code to feed these raw inputs into classes, 
determined by their definition in the original code, to finish processing them into Component objects; which are 
compatible with the Open MDAO optimization framework.
