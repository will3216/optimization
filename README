These are some of the preliminary codes and structures for a piece of local search optimization software.

So far, a script has been written to parse a GAMS input code into raw python input objects. 

The piece of code I am currently working on is nearly finished. This code should feed raw python inputs 
into classes, determined by their definition in the original code, to finish processing their data. Then, 
the OptiModel class should be able to print these objects into a template which creates new Component 
objects; compatible with the Open MDAO optimization framework.
